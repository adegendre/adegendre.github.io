I am the 2022 McKenzie Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <a href="https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/economics" target="_blank">the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne</a>.\ 

I am an economist interested in **applied microeconomics**, **applied econometrics** and the formation of **human capital**. I study how children’s health and education is shaped by their parents, teachers, peers, and education and welfare policies. I am also interested in meta-science and methods to improve the reliability of our empirical research findings. My McKenzie Fellowship project focuses on methods to synthesize and generalize empirical findings in the case of peer effects and teacher role model effects on student performance.\

I exploit natural experiments, and analyze complex survey data and large-scale administrative records from the Netherlands, Taiwan, Spain, and Australia using applied econometric methods for causal inference. Another theme of my research focuses on empirical issues arising with natural experiments and observational data, such as identifying partial non-compliance to cluster treatment assignment in natural experiments or aggregating estimates across studies.
