I am always surprised to hear my junior peers say that they will invest in their writing skills later on in their career, as if writing doesn’t matter for getting our papers published and actually surviving in academia. First of all, the quality of our prose DOES matter for getting our papers out (my co-author Jan Feld just published an experimental study on this!). Second, spending a bit of energy polishing our papers can be enjoyable, much like any craft that one hones with time. Here are some resources that I keep coming back to, especially when I need inspiration for writing:\n\nthe one and only Economical Writing by Deirdre McCloskey and Stephen Ziliak. This book is beautifully written, insightful and hilarious! I love their tip about writing down ideas on single pieces of paper or postits and playing with the order, and the tip about cutting every third word when polishing a text."

With population-level administrative data from South Australia and a regression discontinuity design, we find that eligible infants experienced fewer hospital presentations in the first year of life for preventable, acute, and severe problems. In auxiliary analyses using nationally-representative data, we find that the windfall cash allowed parents to increase expenditures on food and groceries, decreased financial stress and hardship, and improved physical and mental health. We calculate that 34% of the pay-out were recouped within the first year through lower health care costs.\n\nWorking Paper (October 2023) | IZA Discussion Paper (Sep 2021).\nSlides NBER Summer Institute 2022 (July 2022).\n\nSame-Sex Teacher Effects in Education, with Jan Feld, Nicolás Salamanca and Ulf Zölitz.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe idea that students benefit from same-sex teachers has motivated many policies around the world aimed at reducing gender inequalities. However, we do not know the size or generalizability such same-sex teacher effects. We fill this gap by conducting a meta-analysis and our own study using data from 90 countries. Our meta-analysis summarizes the literature and highlights that studies are often underpowered and difficult to compare because they use different methods. Our multi-country study overcomes these shortcomings by providing many high-powered and comparable estimates. Those estimates are ideal for learning about the generalizability of an effect. Our results reveal an interesting pattern. In secondary education, same-sex teacher effects are positive for most countries and outcomes. In primary education, effects are more mixed. For example, we find negative same-sex teacher effects on test scores for about half the countries.

To illustrate its usefulness, we use it to estimate ability peer effects in Taiwan, where we have unusually rich data and a national mandate to randomly assign students to classrooms within schools, but with partial non-compliance. After recovering a valid quasi-experiment, we first estimate ability peer effects in line with other studies.

The analysis involves computational reproducibility checks and robustness assessments. It reveals several patterns. First, we uncover a high rate of fully computationally reproducible results (over 85%). Second, excluding minor issues like missing packages or broken pathways, we uncover coding errors for about 25% of studies, with some studies containing multiple errors. Third, we test the robustness of the results to 5,511 re-analyses. We find a robustness reproducibility of about 70%. Robustness reproducibility rates are relatively higher for re-analyses that introduce new data and lower for re-analyses that change the sample or the definition of the dependent variable. Fourth, 52% of re-analysis effect size estimates are smaller than the original published estimates and the average statistical significance of a re-analysis is 77% of the original. Lastly, we rely on six teams of researchers working independently to answer eight additional research questions on the determinants of robustness reproducibility. Most teams find a negative relationship between replicators’ experience and reproducibility, while finding no relationship between reproducibility and the provision of intermediate or even raw data combined with the necessary cleaning codes.\n\n\nI4R Discussion Paper Series (April 2024).\n\nFrom Subsidies to Loans: The Effects of a National Student Finance Reform on the Choices of Secondary School Students, with Jan Kabátek.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe analyse the effects of a national student finance reform in the Netherlands, which replaced universal subsidies for higher education students by low-interest loans. We show that this reform had a large impact on education choices of secondary school students, lowering their enrolments in college-preparing tracks and increasing the share of students specializing in STEM subjects. The reform also affected the living arrangements of new college entrants. Our findings highlight that secondary school students respond to the modes of higher education financing well ahead of their graduation, and that financial aid uncertainty alone can deter many from pursuing higher education.\n\n\nIZA Discussion Paper (Aug 2021).\n\nTwo Decades of Welfare Reforms in Australia: How Did They Affect Single Mothers and Their Children?, with Stefanie Schurer and Angela Zhang.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWorldwide, single mothers are profoundly time and income constrained, making them heavily reliant on government transfers. We examine how welfare reforms that introduced mutual obligations affected the economic position of single mothers and the development of their children over the past two decades in Australia. Using nationally representative longitudinal data, we show that disposable incomes of single-mother households were significantly reduced relative to partnered mothers since the 2005 Welfare-to-Work Act came into effect in July 2006, a downward trend that was aggravated by the Global Financial Crisis and the 2013 suspension of grandfathered single parenting payment rules. The reform diminished parenting and family payments for single mothers, who compensated income loss by increasing reliance on disability pension payments, work hours, and child-care expenditures. We then use nationally representative cohort data to estimate the impact of single motherhood on child skill development, following children who entered primary school when their mothers were affected by the Welfare-to-Work reform. We find unadjusted single-motherhood gaps of 0.2 SD in cognitive and 0.3 SD in non-cognitive skills. Non-cognitive skill gaps are only partially explained by differences in observable characteristics, while cognitive skill gaps are fully explained by observable characteristics. Differences in disposable household income between single and partnered mother households explain over 50% of the observed cognitive ability gaps in childhood and 25% in late adolescence. In the presence of positive spillover effects, we propose that welfare payments to vulnerable families may function as a social investment rather than a sunk cost.\n\n\nIZA Discussion Paper (Sep 2021)."

Yet, these rank effects generate negative spillovers on younger siblings: a one standard deviation increase in rank decreases younger sibling’s test scores by 2 percent of a standard deviation. These spillovers are stronger for same-sex siblings. I show that changes in parental investments and expectations drive part of these spillovers. In particular, I show that migrant parents increase investments in school quality and speaking Dutch at home. My findings highlight that the peer environment creates within-family human capital spillovers.\n\n\nDraft JMP version (31 August 2022).\n\nAffirmative Action during Early Childhood: School Choice, Academic Performance and School Satisfaction, with Shushanik Margaryan and José Montalban Castilla.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe estimate the impact of income-based priority points on children’s’ outcomes and parental choices from preschool to Grade 6. With administrative records from Madrid, we use two sharp discontinuities in household income per capita which determine income-based priority points within the Boston mechanism. We first show that income-based priority points change parents’ strategy: low-income parents apply to fewer closer schools and schools with lower absenteeism, while higher-income parents apply to more demanded and higher-scoring schools. The priority points increase the likelihood that children are admitted to their preferred school. Yet, we find economically insignificant effects on standardized test scores 6 years later. Lastly, using a matched survey of parents and children, we find small negative effects on parental and child satisfaction with the school, teachers and peers. Our findings indicate that low and higher-income parents respond in sophisticated but different ways to priority rules under the Boston Mechanism.\n\n\nStatus: First draft coming soon.\n\nHow do teachers respond to smaller classes? Evidence and implications for student learning, with Damon Clark, Pierre Deschamps, and José Montalban Castilla.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies how teachers respond to smaller classes and how these responses impact student achievement in the Region of Madrid (Spain), a region of over 1 million school-aged children and 3,000 schools. We exploit the maximum class size rule that generates sharp discontinuities in the relationship between school enrollment and average class size. We estimate the impact of class size reductions on teacher responses and student test scores using regression discontinuity models. We link data covering three key elements at the classroom level: administrative data on student enrollments, administrative data on student test scores and information on teacher responses from teacher survey data covering the universe of teachers and containing rich information on their classroom activities. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that explain how class size reductions can enhance student learning.\n\n\nStatus: Preliminary results.\n\nCollege Information Provision to Disadvantaged Youth, with Gloria Chen and Siqi Pan.\nStatus: RCT in the field."

My previous website was made using RMarkdown and RStudio, but I have now updated to Quarto, which is the modernized version of RMarkdown.\n\nThe official Quarto website to learn everything about Quarto and making Quarto websites.\nA hands on tutorial to set up a basic Quarto website: (short) Youtube series by Joshua French :\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to add a small blog section on my website, and I used this tutorial by Samantha Csik. The idea behind this blog is to exploit the listings feature of Quarto, and to store the posts appropriately.\nNext, I did some custom styling (scss). To start custom styling, create a text file (e.g., “mystyle.scss”) and refer to it in your YAML under “theme”. I like to place this file in my root directly where the css file is also placed, but you can place it wherever you want as long as you refer to it correctly in your YAML file. Samantha Csik also put together a great set of slides here that explains custom styling. See this Youtube video by Albert Rapp for a tutorial:"

    "text": "This is a topic that I find particularly important. I was lucky to have peers at Maastricht Uni with whom I could have great discussions about research practices, ethics and how to do our research the best we could – big shoutout to Henrik Zaunbrecher and to my amazing coauthors Jan Feld, Nicolás Salamanca and Ulf Zölitz for giving me so much food for thought. We talked a lot about the replication crisis and the file drawer problem (among many things). Here are some resources I’ve found over the years that have nourished my thoughts on this topic, and have helped me progress in my own practices.\n\nThis book Transparent and Reproducible Social Science Research by Garret Christensen, Jeremy Freese, and Edward Miguel. A fantastic introduction into the issues of the replicability problems, the incentive problems in modern science and practical advice to improve our research practices to move forward collectively. It’s also a relatively quick and easy read.\n\nThe Institute for Replication is a research lab led by Abel Brodeur and his team. They do amazing work to normalize replications, increase awareness around the need for replicating papers, and improving researchers’ incentives to replicate the work of others and make their own work more replicable. They have tons of teaching resources to transmit best practices to students, check out their website!\n\nData Colada is a great blog maintained by Profs. Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson and Joe Simmons. This blog is a gem: they keep the tone light but they always making you see things from a new perspective. They do some very serious data forensic work, write about best practices (e.g. I LOVE their post about the Groundhogday package for versioning in R), and propose new ways to detect p-hacking – among other topics.\nPeople and institutions to follow who do very interesting work on meta-science: the BITSS (Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences), Simine Vazire and Fiona Fidler who co-direct the MetaMelb Research Group. I also find a lot of inspiration in the work and blog of Andrew Gelman and Rachael Meager.\nA two-part podcast on Freakonomics Radio just came out about academic fraud. They invited some of the most influential researchers at the forefront of the discussions on meta-science and what we can do to improve research practices: Brian Nosek, Simine Vazire, Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson and Joe Simmons. Highly recommend both podcasts:\n\nPart 1: EPISODE 572 Why Is There So Much Fraud in Academia?\nPart 2: EPISODE 573 Can Academic Fraud Be Stopped?"
